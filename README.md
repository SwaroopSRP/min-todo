# Min ToDo
Min ToDo is your yet another simple and minimalistic Todo list manager. Just to the point, quick to use and suckless UX.

As I go further on my [web development jouney](https://github.com/SwaroopSRP/learning-web-dev), this my first simple project after learning JavaScript like most of web developers: a todo list!

## All About This Project
- Quick and simple user experience
- Suckless, reactive UI
- Optimized viewing for smaller screens
- Works on vanilla JS
- Works on browser local storage (no sync, but data stays persistent within your device)
- Built using TailwindCSS

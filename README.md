# min-todo
Min ToDo is your yet another simple and minimalistic Todo list manager with no extra BS. Just to the point, quick to use and suckless UX.

As I go further on my [web development jouney](https://github.com/SwaroopSRP/learning-web-dev), this my first simple project after learning JavaScript like most of web developers: a todo list!

## Features
- Quick and simple user experience
- Optimized for smaller screen (well, at least tried to)
- Works on vanilla JS (so no view mess-ups)
- Works on local storage (sadly)
- Built using TailwindCSS
